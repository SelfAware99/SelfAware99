ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SelfAware99 I'm currently learning how to code on my own (love you YouTube) after leaving my dream of becoming a Software Engineer behind due to my lack of abilities with math and of course my understanding of life at the moment lol.


Today I start another journey proving to myself that I have always been able to learn how to code properly after these 8 years of a professional career in another path.

I'm currently learning Kotlin which has been proving to be a must in terms of Android development which is the area that I'm interested in right now.

I'm currently 26 years old willing to give my life another start. As many say, it is never too late to pursue your dreams and passions.

Here I am. If we can learn together that would be awesome! of course, I will be adding more skills to my profile once I take on Android Development to a pro-level. Stay tuned for a personal Blog!


When I become an Android Developer I will update my description :)
